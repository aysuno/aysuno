### Hi! I'm Aysun :raising_hand:


I'm a computer science and engineering student at SabancÄ± University. Visual computing, HCI, HRI and AI are the areas that interest me the most :sparkler:

- :computer: I'm currently learning many things and trying to figure out which one I like best
- :mag_right: Iâ€™m currently working on a website project for students
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaborate on everything!
